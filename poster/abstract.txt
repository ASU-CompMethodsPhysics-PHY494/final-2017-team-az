Population Dynamics

While mankind has an impact on animal populations through long-term effects like climate change, we can also cause more immediate impacts through things like overhunting, deforestation, and the introduction of foreign animals and disease into animal populations.   Inspired by this, our goal for this project was to model a realistic food web, with creatures of the local Sonoran desert forming our example, and model what impact the sudden severe reduction of one population might have on the rest within the system.  Utilizing the Lotka-Volterra system of first order ODEs, which are then integrated using the Runge-Kutta 4 method of integration, our project allows for a food web that involves both predator-prey relationships and competition between predators.  Initial populations were able to be determined from real-world population statistics, but the other parameters for our system of ODEs were not readily available, and were instead contrived to form a stabilized system.  Our findings show that, while our system is resilient to sudden impacts leading to extinction, these impacts severely impact other populations and rarely ever does the system recover to the same equilibrium as before.  Accuracy of future results could be improved by sourcing further real-world data for parameters.
